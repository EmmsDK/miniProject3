- What type/s of regression have you applied?
  - I have only used linear regression. I could have used multiple linear regression. I tried to add polynomial regression but ended up figuring out that it was not possible.

- Which were the challenges?
  - Since we have not had much practice with streamlit, converting my jupyter file to a file that works on streamlit have been a big challenge. I finally got it to work but when trying to publish it on streamlit community i got even more errors regarding some imports.
  - Additionally, importing libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn have been a big issue when trying to convert it into streamlit. I still dont know how it works propperly and I have had to hard download it throgh anaconda to get it to work.

- How accurate is your solution?
  - My first two models show that there is a correlation between the square foot of the living space and the price. They show that within the 1250 sqft to the 2500sqft, the price is relatively close and increase with the sqft relatively well. There are of course some outlier where the price and the sqft does not have any correlation with the other propperties. 

- What could be done for further improvement of the accuracy?
  - The primary thing I could have done to further improve my accuracy is to remove the propperties where the price compared to the square feet does not correspond with the majority of the data. Here I could have looked into multiple linear regression to create the most accurate possible solution.
